## Overview and Entry to Website
At this website, language learners can group to practice the languages they're learning. On the home page, there's a navigation bar at the top that has links to content that will get the most use. At the bottom is another navigation bar with links that we expect to be used less often.

## Calendar
The Calendar is where events are organized. The default view is the current month. From there, one may go back or forward a month, or they may add a new event. **To come are indicators on each day to show how many events exist.**

### Creating a New Event
Clicking Add an Event takes the user to a form where they enter details about the event. Each field must be filled out for the form to work. Clicking in the date field brings up a date picker, the time field is split up into hour, minute and am/pm sections, and clicking in the Location field allows the user to search for a location that's in the Google Places platform.

### Event Details and Deletion
Clicking on a day on the calendar takes you to a detail page for that day. For those days that have events, details about all the day's events will be displayed. One may choose to delete an event from this page, and when they do, they'll be presented a confirmation dialog that will require confirmation for the deletion to take place. If they decide not to delete after all, they can cancel.

### Updating an Event
Clicking the Edit link on one of the Event Details panels takes the user to the Update Event form. Fill out all the fields or the form won't work. Click cancel to return to the previously viewed day without submitting the form.

## Future Features
- The Chat and Forum links are works in progress and not functional yet.
- The Profile page is partially functional - the form works, but there's no profile image submission capability yet, and I have more content to go on this page.
- The Contact form is a work in progress, and the Learning Apps page (a listing of apps to use for learning languages) isn't started yet.

I've done a bunch with this site so far, but there's still much more to do. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to lingo.connect.info@gmail.com

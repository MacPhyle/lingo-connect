<h1>Lingo Connect</h1>
<h2>Community-driven language learning</h2>
A platform where native speakers connect with language learners for personalized lessons and cultural exchange.

<h2>Reason for creating this project:</h2>
<strong>Fun fact:</strong> more than 50% of the residents of Yakima, Washington are native Spanish speakers, and many speak only Spanish.

<strong>Bet you didn't expect that, when this is Washington, not a state at the southern border. Right?</strong>

As a Yakima resident whose Spanish is sadly lacking, I'd like to become fluent in this great language, for 2 reasons:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Get to know my neighbors better
</li>
<li>
Have more to offer potential employers
</li>
</ul>

And I expect that my Spanish-speaking neighbors might like an opportunity to get better at English or another language.
